The database files can be found in /protected/data
The database file is is named comics.sql.
Import it into your mysql dbms(I used phpMyadmin).
I have not yet included means of inserting into the db so it must be done manually for now
but will add the feature soon.
Try the project by putting all files into ur server root directory,
then accessing the index file.
Access the files in the protected directory for the code of the model,views and controllers.
